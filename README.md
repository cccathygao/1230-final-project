# 1230-final-project

- An .obj file parser imports the bird model and renders it in the scene
- The terrain is procedurally generated in real-time
- A real-time depth of field control that
  - manipulate the focus point
  - manipulate the focus scale
 - For the background, user can also choose to use a skybox to render a environment map instead of the terrain
 - Within the skybox, user can toggle a reflective cube

- In the second scene, we created a skybox to serve as the background.
- A skybox is a large cube that encompasses the entire scene and contains 6 images of a surrounding environment. We fold those 6 sides to get the completely textured cube that simulates a large landscape.
- We also implemented environment mapping with a reflective cube. The cube is rotating in real-time and reflecting the environment.
